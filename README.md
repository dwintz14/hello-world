One day, a priest was driving home when a cop pulled him over.

The cop said, "Father, it seems that you were speeding and it looks a bit like you've been swerving. Have you had anything to drink today?"

The priest replied, "No, of course not! Just a couple glasses of water"

The cop remarked, "Your breath smells a bit like wine"

The priest exclaimed, "Son of a bitch, He did it again!"
